### Smokes

#### 1. Mid Window - Instant Spawn Smokes
    Importance: Throwing mid smokes as fast as possible denies as much information to the CT's and helps you gain mid control.
    
    There are 17 Mirage spawns. You can throw instant mid smokes from 12 of these spawns.
    
    Check this video out by _NartOutHere_ for the lineups:
